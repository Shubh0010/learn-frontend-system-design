# Dependency Security

## Regular Audits for Dependencies

- Conduct regular audits of dependencies to identify vulnerabilities. Tools like npm audit or yarn audit can help detect vulnerabilities in npm packages. Take necessary actions to update or fix vulnerable dependencies.

## Enforcing Dependency Auditing

- Enforce dependency auditing within your development workflow. For example, set up npm to enable auditing by default using npm set audit true. 
- Utilize tools like dependabot.yml to automate checks for vulnerabilities in npm packages over time. 
- Implement security scans as part of your CI/CD pipeline to ensure that vulnerabilities are detected before merging changes into the main branch.

## Dependency Monitoring

- Implement dependency monitoring solutions to continuously track and manage dependencies. Tools like CodeQL can analyze both your code and external dependencies for security issues, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities.

## Dependency Locking

- Utilize package-lock.json or yarn.lock files to lock dependency versions. This ensures that dependencies are only updated when necessary and helps prevent unintended changes or compatibility issues.

## Security Penetration Testing

- Conduct security penetration testing, such as using App Scanner tools, to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities in your application's dependencies. Regularly test your application's security posture to proactively identify and mitigate risks.
