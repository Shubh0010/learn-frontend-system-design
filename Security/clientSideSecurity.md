# Client-Side Security

## Storing Sensitive Data on Client Storage
  
  - The preferred approach is to store sensitive data on the server-side whenever feasible.
  - Encrypt the data stored on the client-side to add an extra layer of security.
  - Utilize token expiry mechanisms to limit the lifespan of tokens containing sensitive information.

## Authentication

  - Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth tokens for secure authentication.
  - Enforce session token expiry to prevent unauthorized access to user sessions.
  - Consider Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced security measures.

## Data Integrity

  - Ensure data integrity by generating checksums for stored data. This allows detection of any unauthorized modifications to the data.

## Storage Limitations

  - Different client-side storage options have varying storage capacities:

    - localStorage: Typically allows storage of 5-10 MB of data.
    - sessionStorage: Similar storage capacity to localStorage.
    - indexedDB: Offers larger storage capacities, ranging from 50 MB to 100 MB.
    - Cookies: Limited to smaller sizes, typically between 4 KB to 20 KB.
    - Cache: Can store approximately 100 MB of data.
    - Monitor and estimate storage usage using navigator.storage, adjusting data thresholds accordingly.

## Session Management
  
  -Ensure that cookies are set to HttpOnly and Secure to mitigate certain types of attacks.
